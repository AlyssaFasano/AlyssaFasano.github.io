I guess you can say that the journey leading up to my decision to enroll in Flatiron began as a joke. When I was younger, maybe teenage years, the running joke amongst my family members was, 

"Alyssa, have you reached the end of the internet yet?"

I **lived** on my computer. I came home from school and got on the computer, I ate my meals there whenever I could get away with it, I remember one time even falling asleep on my desk because I had been on it for so long! The internet was still a relatively new concept to most. It was this big mysterious, potentially scary and dangerous thing that my parents knew very little about except that their daughter seemed to be utterly fascinated by it; borderline obsessed with it. They worked hard to maintain a balance in my life. I stayed in sports for the most part and my time spent online was monitored to the best of their ability. It probably seemed that no matter what restrictions they put on my online time, I found some way around them. 

Moral of the story? I **loved** being on the computer and learning and tinkering and playing. It was all I ever wanted to do. I played games, I kept online journals, I learned some code, I ventured out into cyberspace with no real direction or goal in mind; I just knew I loved working on my computer.

I began teaching myself HTML at a young age and created some little websites here and there. My biggest code-related accomplishment was actually during those years when I had created a website for my mother. At the time, she was attending graduate school to become a teacher and one of her final projects was developing a working website. She called upon her teenage daughter for help and voila! A teacher was made and a coder was born. 

Fast forward about ten years. I had just graduated college with my bachelor's in political science and had every intention of taking the plunge into law school. I decided to take some time off from school and began working as a paralegal in a pretty decent sized law firm in New York. One year off from school turned to two -- turned to three and before I knew it, I was working on my fourth year at the firm and not pursuing a law degree. I had moved up in the office relatively quickly and even had my name on the door at some point. Might not seem like a big deal, but to me it was pretty cool. Anyway, I remember sitting in my office one day looking at the same old spreadsheets, running the same old reports and printing the same old documents that I did the week before and the week before that. 

I was bored.

I wasn't going to move up in my firm any time soon; I wasn't even sure I wanted to anyway. I knew I didn't want to be a paralegal or a department supervisor for the rest of my life. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I was 100% positive it wasn't sitting in an office working on seemingly pointless spreadsheets day after day after day. 

One day, I decided to quit my job and go back to school. Surprisingly enough, this still wasn't the point at which I decided to code. I entertained the thought of becoming a teacher (mostly for the schedule) but spent less than a week inside of a classroom and knew that wasn't meant for me. I enrolled in the local community college and began taking some prerequisites in the computer science field. 

I. WAS. HOOKED.

Immediately. I started remembering what it felt like to use my brain and to problem solve and I couldn't get enough. I lived for the challenge and then that moment when it all clicks and you get a working solution or the right answer to an equation. I had forgotten what that felt like for a long time. I realized shortly after taking my first class that ***this*** was what I wanted to do with my life. It combines two things that I have found I am extremely passionate about; using my brain and of course -- computers. I have officially come full circle; back where it all began! Right here in front of my computer.
