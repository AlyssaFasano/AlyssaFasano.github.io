One of my biggest fears, in this world that is filled with so many opportunities for growth, is that one day I am going to stop wanting to learn. The ability to learn could arguably be the most powerful tool that human beings possess. I recently had a conversation with my son about this very concept; that the mind has *unlimited* learning potential. The idea that there is literally *nothing* that the brain cannot be taught. What machine do we know of that has limitless potential for knowledge? The human brain is exponentially more powerful than any machine or computer know to man. It's quite difficult to try and understand just how powerful the human brain really is. 

For instance; prior to enrolling at The Flatiron School, I had *extremely* limited exposure to writing code. I woke up one day (not really, refer to the previous post for some back story) and decided that I wanted to be able to communicate with a computer. A little planning, some number crunching and a couple of weeks later, here I am! Learning to speak the language of the computer! In a matter of two short months I have already stretched my brain to comprehend this entirely new and unfamiliar matter. I am most definitely starting from square one. However, the more I immerse myself in the material, study and practice, the easier it is becoming. My brain is evolving into something more advanced than it was before. 

Ever since this "awakening" if you well, I've come to the conclusion that I **never want to stop learning or stop growing. I never want to settle for mediocrity.**

I never want to just be content with the life I'm living. I want to stretch my brain every day. If one day I master something that I have been working on, I want to learn something new. I would argue that what makes all of the greats -- well, great -- is their ability to continually move forward. They have this unquenchable thirst for knowledge and understanding and mastering. The journey that has lead me to this particular point has been life-changing. Finally grasping the concept that there is literally nothing that you can't "be good at" and there is nothing that cannot be learned has unlocked a fierce eagerness to learn within me that I didn't know existed. 

I used to say all the time that I could not do something because I simply just wasn't good at that. Admittedly, that was a statement made mostly in ignorance of the fact that I was not good at that particular thing because I had never studied and practiced that particular thing. Being able to understand that behind every "great" or behind every achievement is hours, days, weeks, months and sometimes years of study and practice is relatively new to me. What I was lacking before this new coding experience was the understanding that the things I am great at, I've spent countless hours learning how to be great at them. I now have the maturatity to see that although I'm not very good *right now*, that with enough time and practive under my belt, I *will* be one day. 

Rather than looking at someone or something and simply saying "I can never be/do that because I'm not good at it" I now say "I wonder *how* good at that I would be if I studied and practiced."
