I would argue that any time a person decides to take on anything new, whether it be a hobby or skill or class, there is this inevitable, often painful, period of growth. I imagine the graph of this learning curve is just a massive exponential growth function sky-rocketing off the axes to some unknown end point with a horrifyingly steep slope. Okay, so admittedly that was a little bit dramatic but you get the idea. Learning something new is HARD! We can all agree that the student must absorb *a lot of information* and usually within a fairly short amount of time. 

Wellllll...that's where I'm at. I'm right smack dab in the middle of this uphill climb of learning code. Some days are not so bad and others? It's safe to say that other days I feel like an infant. So I thought it would be interesting to document some of the thoughts I've had so far while learning how to code. Maybe one day in the future I will look back on these snippets and laugh. 

Thought number one!

## 1. I've never felt so smart and so stupid at the same time.
If you're like me, you've had the following moment more times than you probably care to admit.

*Staring at computer, chin in the palm of my hand*
<p> "What am I missing here?" </p>
<p>*Whisper softly to no one because I'm usually alone in this small space that was carved out in my house and kind of sort of resembles an office*</p>
<p>*Squint -- eyes dart back and forth across the screen. Lean closer to the monitor*</p>
<p>"I don't see anything. Why is this failing?"</p>
<p>*Run same test 16 more times.*</p>
<p>*Deep breath*</p>
<p>"It has to be somewhere."</p>
<p>*Rub eyes, stretch, scroll up, examine -- scroll down, examine.*</p>
<p>"I've spent way too much time on this -- let me just ask for help at this point."</p>
<p>*Ask a question in a very public space*</p>
<p>"Aha!! I found it! That period doesn't belong there!"</p>
<p>*Regrets asking question in very public space.*</p>
<p>"Never mind! I found it! Heh -- silly meeee."</p>
<p>*Cancels question. Embarrassed; laughs"</p>

Okay so it's definitely not always just a misplaced period or a typo, but you get the idea. Here i am learning how to communicate with this machine and feeling like a genius because I am finally beginning to create functioning code without having to google everything, and yet sometimes the **simplest** mistake is made and everything breaks and fails. 

## 2. Clarity lives in the shower
Am I alone in this, or does everything just make better sense in the shower?? I cannot tell you how many times in the last few months that the solution to an outstanding problem in my code just hits me like a ton of bricks in the middle of washing my hair. When I hit a wall in my code, the problem tends to consume my thoughts until I've resolved it. I will admit that I don't sit around banging my head against the wall until the answer comes to me, but the thought will definitely cross my mind over and over throughout the day at random times. I will just be standing over the sink, washing dishes and wondering why my method is stopping where it is or I'll be driving to the gym talking to my four year old about what I could be doing wrong. It seems, however, that nothing works better than taking a shower! Just recently I was standing in the shower and an idea came to me -- seemingly out of thin air. I got so excited that once I got out of the shower, I wrapped myself up in a towel and sat in front of my computer *in my towel* to test my idea. Sounds weird, but it totally worked! Now every time I get stuck on something in my lab, I run and jump in the shower.

Just kidding. 

But I'm not against it if it will save me the hours and energy trying to avoid the scenario up above!

## 3. I'm never going to be get a handle on this
* I'm never going to understand this
* No one is ever going to hire me
* I feel like I have accomplished nothing
* What am I even doing
* This is taking a lot longer than I expected
* So on and so forth

I'm not going to lie to you, more often than not -- these are the types of thoughts that run through my head in the midst of all of this. But then, just as I'm ready to throw in the towel, something happens. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. 

I get it.

Something clicks, I get what I once did not understand and all of those fears are wiped away. That is, of course, until my next failing test.

## 4 The coding community is unique 
In my opinion, there is such a strong sense of teamwork within the coding community. This is the first time in my adult life, outside of forced 'team building exercises', where I have felt supported and encouraged by people who have never met me in once in real life. I am constantly blown away by the kindness and patience of more experienced programmers. I am totally aware of the simple nature of my questions sometimes (*cough* all the time) and I am never on the receiving end of any condescending tone or attitude. I have found that there is a remarkable sense of togetherness that doesn't seem to be even an effort for anyone. This community is a breath of fresh air and one that I hope to be a part of for a very long time. 

Job well done senior programmers! Us newbies really have a lot to thank you for!

## 5. I'm so glad I made the jump
If you've read my first blog post, you know that I left a job where I was very comfortable, fairly secure (by today's standards) and was making decent money. I would not change a THING. Being able to take this opportunity to learn and be a part of this whole new world is something that I would not give up right now. Yes, this can be frustrating. Yes, it is challenging and yes, it is without a doubt tedious. But! It is interesting and rewarding and gratifying. These types of things, I've learned, are priceless. These aspects are what I have been missing from my professional life and all I can say is that I'm glad the search is over!

This is it for now. I can't wait to read back on these thoughts in a couple of months or years to see what / if anything has changed. 

Thanks for reading!
